# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## __Overview:__


The purpse of this project is to build a dashboard that displays information about bacteria samples collected from multiple research participants, so that both the participants and the researchers can view the same in one place.

The webpage has a dropdown menu from which the ID of a participant can be selected. Based on the selected ID, the information displayed changes dynamically. The page displays demographic information about the selected participant ID. 

A bar graph displays the IDs of the different bacteria found in the participant and the quantity found of each species. A gauge chart displays the belly button washing frequency of the participant, while a bubble chart displays the bacteria cultures per sample.

The dashboard has been furthe customized by adding a header image, a background color and a brief description on how to use the page.
